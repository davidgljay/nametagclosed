    <p>After two years of intense learning about facilitated small groups conversations online, Nametag has closed. While the company could not continue, learnings from the project went on to have a substantive impact on the 2018 midterm elections and on digital strategies in a variety of movements. The key learnings are as follows.</p>

    <p>Nametag was a chat platform designed to reproduce the experience of a well-facilitated small group conversation. It emphasized group norms, structured introductions, and clear calls to action for participants. Discussions were typically convened by a facilitator and would run for a few hours to a few days at a time.</p>
    <p>Compared to large-group asynchronous platforms, such as E-mail lists or Facebook Groups, or public Slack channels, Nametag rooms had the following properties:</p>
      <h3>Much Higher Engagement</h3>with over 70% of participants actively engaging in conversation (best estimates for asynchronous platforms are all south of 10%.)
      <h3>More Meaningful and Vulnerable Conversation</h3>with participants regularly sharing personal stories and expressing a willingness to engage with new ideas. Clearly defined norms and a high participant-to-facilitator ratio successfully prevented conversations from becoming toxic.
      <h3>More People Contributing and Taking Action</h3>in conversations that involved clear calls to action, between 10 and 20% of participants would either donate or commit to some other action step. High rates donation rates in these conversations, including conversion to recurring donations, imply a powerful new model for organizations seeking to activate a community, though this opportunity was not able to be fully explored.
